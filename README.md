## :dart: About

The code starts by declaring a variable called "billTotal" that will hold the total cost of the meal. It also declares a variable called "customTip" that will hold the tip amount. The code then creates an input field for people to enter their number of guests and calculates how much each person should pay in order to make up the bill total. The function getInputValue is used to calculate what each person should pay based on their number of guests, which is stored in numOfPeople. The function reset clears all variables so they are ready for new calculations when submit() is called later on. Finally, submit() calls calculate(), which takes into account any discounts or gratuities given out during this process, and returns it as a string with two decimal places (e.g., $12).

The code starts by getting the value of the billTotal variable. Then it gets the value of customTip, which is a text input field that allows users to enter their own tip amount. The code then gets the number of people in attendance at this event and stores that information in numOfPeople. Finally, it gets the total amount for tips and displays that on a label called "total_amount."
